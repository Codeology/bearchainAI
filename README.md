- **Project Leaders:** Trevor Trinh, Anna Chung
- **Project Blurb:** Tech moves fast, and the fields of blockchain and AI are no exception. Having the ability to operate at the cutting edge is fundamental for both feeding your curiosity and advancing your career in computer science. Our project serves as a gateway of understanding to these technologies, providing hands-on experience with the latest tools and frameworks. We'll be building a web application that utilizes the GPT-3 Davinci artificial intelligence model (fine-tuned with web scraped references) to generate new fanfictions. Motivated by the issue of creator credit in AI-generated media, new fanfiction along with their reference authors will be recorded on the Ethereum blockchain as non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
- **Tech areas:**
  - Blockchain, ML, Web Scraping, Web Dev
- **Tools/technologies involved:**
  - Blockchain: Solidity, Alchemy, Polygon, Hardhat, MetaMask
  - Machine Learning Model: GPT-3 Davinci & Ada
  - Web Scraping: Beautiful Soup, lmxl parser
  - Web dev: Next.js, React, Chakra UI
  - Languages: Python, Solidity, JavaScript (TypeScript)

Guide for installing and configuring all required software and accounts

### Programs

<details><summary>a code editor</summary>

- any code editor should work but we recommend Visual Studio Code, which you can download [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) !
- Visual Studio Code Python Set Up

  - install the Python extension by Microsoft
  - install a Python interpreter
    - refer to [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial) for detailed instructions plus instructions on setting up a simple python program to test that you‚Äôre set up works for python
  - select Python interpreter version
    - do (ctrl+shift+P) or (cmd+shift+P) to open up the command palette
    - type in ‚ÄúPython: Select Interpreter‚Äù and make sure it is a version before 3.11
  - make code runner run python3 instead of python in VSC terminal

    - open settings
      - Windows/Linux - File>Preferences>Settings
      - macOS - Code>Preferences>Settings
    - type in preferences: one of the results should have an ‚Äúedit in settings.json‚Äù link, click it
